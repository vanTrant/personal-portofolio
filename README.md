# Personal Portofolio

I create this in order to complete Responsive Web Design Challenge from [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). This portofolio is created using HTML and pure CSS.

## Getting started

You can preview the page at [Github page](https://vantrant.github.io/personal-portofolio/).<br /> 
In this portofolio, my primary purpose is to showcase my ability to create animation in CSS.

### Prerequisites

* Any browser will do, but in this case i'm using Chrome.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vanTrant/personal-portofolio.git
   ```
   or simply download the code.<br />
2. Press Ctrl+O in Chrome and open index.html


## Version History

As of update 1.1, I will not improve this portofolio any further because there are so many project assignments in my college.

* 1.1

* 1.0
    * Initial release
